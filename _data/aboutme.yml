About : >
  Hi, I graduated with a Master's in Electrical Engineering (specialization in Robotics and Computer Vision) from 
  the [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/) in Winter'24. In addition to my studies, I worked 
  as a Graduate Student Researcher at the [Visual Computing Group](https://vcg.ece.ucr.edu/) of UCR with a focus on 
  3D Computer Vision, Generative AI and Temporally Continuous Pose Estimation for Videos. Previously, I have worked 
  as a Project Assistant at [Visual Computing Lab, IISc Bangalore](http://visual-computing.in/home/) under the 
  supervision of [Dr. Anirban Chakraborty](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=NtAsZK-2HjcC&hl=en).
  My primary research interest lies in the intersection of Deep Learning and Computer Vision. I focus on leveraging 
  Unsupervised and Semi-supervised Learning techniques for domain adaptation. I have exposure to other fields like 
  Natural Language Processing, Electronics, Communication systems, CAD, Graphic Designing, Video Editing, etc. <br><br>
  As an undergrad student, I have done my research intern under [Prof. Hongliang Ren](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rcF7N44AAAAJ&hl=en), 
  NUS. I have also worked with a senior scientist at DRDO on a drone image based object detection and tracking 
  project. <br><br>
  I completed my undergraduate degree from [Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT), Nagpur, India](http://vnit.ac.in/) 
  (Batch of 2021). During my bachelor's, I have incessantly worked at [IvLabs, the AI and Robotics Lab](http://www.ivlabs.in/) under 
  [Dr. Shital Chiddarwar](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=B9InqKQAAAAJ&hl=en). Being a core coordinator of the lab, 
  I have mentored motivated juniors and conducted workshops. I am open to collaborations and looking forward to connecting with people 
  working in similar domains.
